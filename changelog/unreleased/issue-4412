Change: Keep packs size closer to target size

Restic treated the target pack size value (--pack-size or the environment variable RESTIC_PACK_SIZE)
as rather a minimum value for pack sizes. Sometimes a pack size was more than twice the target size.
Restic now makes an effort to ensure that packs do not exceed the target size,
although in some cases packs may still exceed it.
